## Step-by-Step Timeline Method
Since PGN does not store times, reconstruct them from the video:

1. Open the broadcast.  
2. Pause after each move to note both clocks.  
3. Record in a table: Move | Caruana's clock | Kasparov's clock | Notes.  
4. Highlight tempo shifts: Caruana burns time in buildup, Kasparov plays faster and keeps a time edge.

### Example Timeline (first moves)

| Move        | Caruana (White) | Kasparov (Black) | Notes                          |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1. e4 e6    | 5:00            | 5:00             | Opening French setup           |
| 2. d4 d5    | 4:58            | 4:59             | Both still fast                |
| 3. Nc3 Nf6  | 4:55            | 4:58             | Caruana thinking slightly longer |
| 4. e5 Nfd7  | 4:50            | 4:57             | Kasparov plays instantly       |
| 5. f4 c5    | 4:40            | 4:55             | Caruana burns time, Kasparov strikes quickly |

## Why This Matters
- Kasparov's edge -> He kept a time advantage by relying on intuition.  
- Caruana's struggle -> His precise style cost him seconds, and blitz magnifies that.  
- Tempo analogy -> The clocks are like BPM markers in a live set, Kasparov kept the rhythm driving forward, while Caruana slowed down in the buildup.
